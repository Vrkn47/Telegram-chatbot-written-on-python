Hi, this repository contains the source code for a telegram chatbot written in Python.

This is a simple chat bot that has the functions of randomly generating numbers on the command / random, repeating a message to the user on the command / repeat, and the bot can also moderate chats for the presence of obscene language, it is important to note that the dictionary for moderation can be replenished using the command / setwords.

To install, just clone this repository and into a file chat_bot_tg_git.py in the string TOKEN = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE', insert your token that was given to you by BotFather (https://t.me/BotFather ).

I created this bot to practice programming in python, I will also be glad if you offer your ideas for improving this bot.

If you find any errors in the code or have any ideas for improving the bot, write to me at romankvasov20@gmail.com
